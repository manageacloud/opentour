## Authentication

The backoffice web service requires user authentication. The authentication is configured via Google. 

To enable the authentication you need to create the environment variables for `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_SECRET`.

You can generate those credentials via the [Google Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
